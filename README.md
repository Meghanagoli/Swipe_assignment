# Swipe Internship Assignment - AI-Powered Interview Assistant

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application that functions as an AI-powered interview assistant. The application is designed to facilitate a timed interview experience, where an interviewee answers questions generated by AI, and the interviewer has access to detailed candidate profiles, scores, and histories.

The application includes two primary tabs:
- **Interviewee (Chat)**: For candidates to upload resumes, answer AI-generated interview questions, and receive scores.
- **Interviewer (Dashboard)**: For interviewers to view candidate details, including resumes, answers, and AI-generated summaries.

## Features

### Interviewee (Chat)
- **Resume Upload**: Candidates can upload their resume (PDF or DOCX format). Key information like Name, Email, and Phone is extracted from the resume.
- **Missing Information Handling**: If any required information is missing, the chatbot prompts the candidate to fill in the missing fields before starting the interview.
- **Timed Interview Flow**: 
  - AI dynamically generates a series of 6 questions for the candidate (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard).
  - Each question has a specific timer (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s).
  - The system automatically submits the answer if the timer runs out and moves to the next question.
  - At the end of the interview, the AI calculates a final score and generates a short summary.

### Interviewer (Dashboard)
- **Candidate List**: Displays a list of candidates, ordered by score.
- **Detailed View**: Clicking on a candidate reveals their detailed profile, including:
  - All questions asked
  - Answers provided
  - AI-generated scores and summary
- **Search and Sort**: Interviewers can search candidates by name and sort them based on scores.

### Persistence and State Management
- **Local Storage**: The application uses Redux (with redux-persist or IndexedDB) to store all interview data, including timers, answers, and progress. This ensures that the state persists even if the page is refreshed or reopened.
- **Welcome Back Modal**: If a candidate returns to an unfinished session, a modal appears to continue from where they left off.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux for local persistence and mongoDB for all candidates details 
- **UI Libraries**: Tail wind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js 
- **AI Integration**: Use of Gemini AI APIs to generate interview questions, judge answers, and calculate scores.
